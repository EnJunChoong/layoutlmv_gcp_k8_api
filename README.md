# TERRAFORM + GKE + FASTAPI + HUGGINGFACE

## Business Problem

>Imagine you are one of two founders of a start-up that specializes in document processing, you want to build a general document-form understanding API that your future customers can use to automate their paper forms. You donâ€™t know how many customers you will have nor how many requests per day. But some market research has shown that your potential customers can process thousands of forms a day. Knowing the rough requirements, you decided to use cloud services for the flexibility to scale up and down.

Priorities:
1. Cost efficient 
   * Preemptible nodes
2. Highly scalable solution
   * Horizontal Autoscaling
3. Endpoints and resources secured from CyberSec perspective.
   * Private GKE cluster
   * Authorization Token to consume endpoint

## Steps

### 1. Authenticate to GCloud SDK

    Assuming Gcloud SDK has been installed. Else [link here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    ```bash
    $ gcloud auth application-default 
    ```
### 2. Terraform Plan and Apply

    To learn about using and installing terraform: [link here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
    ```bash
    # Make sure you make adjustments to the variables.tf and main.tf for your environment. 
    cd terraform
    terraform plan -out tf.plan 
    terraform apply tf.plan          
    ```
    Might need to run a few times, because some services API needs to be enabled for the first time. 

### 3. Download model files from hugging face

   ```bash
   # CD to app directory and create folder for models
   cd app
   mkdir models    
   ```
    
   Thank you [philschmid](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tuning-layoutlm) !
   ```python
   # You need to have transformer library installed
   # !pip install transformer

   from transformers import LayoutLMForTokenClassification, LayoutLMv2Processor
   model_path = "philschmid/layoutlm-funsd"
   save_to = "models/philschmid/layoutlm-funsd"
   processor = LayoutLMv2Processor.from_pretrained(model_path)
   model = LayoutLMForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
   processor.save_pretrained(save_to)
   model.save_pretrained(save_to)
   ```

### 4. Build docker image and push to artifact registry

Install docker following this instruction: [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
```bash
# Need to configure google cloud auth for docker registry
gcloud auth configure-docker asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev 

# Configure environment variable
export IMAGE_NAME="layoutlmv2"
export IMAGE_TAG="v1-1"
export LOCATION="asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev"
export REGISTRY="$LOCATION/<PROJECT NAME>/<REGISTRY NAME>"
export IMAGE_PATH="$REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG"

# Build docker image and push to GCP artifact registry
# https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME ./app/
docker tag $IMAGE_NAME:latest $IMAGE_PATH
docker push $IMAGE_PATH
```

### 5. Deploy Docker image to GKE as a service
Also setup horizonal pod autoscaler and expose the service thru external LB

kubectl needs to be installed: [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
Also setup kubectl access to GCloud GKE cluster: [link](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl)
```bash
# Setup credential to cluster via gcloud
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME

# Register secret key to gke cluster
kubectl apply -f kubectl_configs/secrets.yaml # file excluded from git. This is where the secret key for decoding the token is defined. 

# Deploy app to gke cluster
envsubst < kubectl_configs/layoutlmv2_deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
# Setup horizontal pod autoscaler
envsubst < kubectl_configs/layoutlmv2_hpa.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
# Create service with external load balancer
envsubst < kubectl_configs/layoutlmv2_extlb_svc.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Rollout restart to apply changes
kubectl rollout restart deployment $IMAGE_NAME
```

## CONGRATS! Your app is now deployed on GKE
Run command to test
```bash
wget http://wimcol.org/uploads/Exam_Notice.jpg && \
curl -m 10\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -F "file=@Exam_Notice.jpg" \
  http://<LoadBalancer END POINT>:80/inference_image/
  ```
